VueJS_Regionalshopping

# Importent Information to use:

This project need a Database like Googles FirebaseDB, JSON DB include
User authentification (for setting the values).

Possible user registration with the register-page includes this project.
Administration Account (+ API Key) for Firebase (or like FirebaseDB) is needed.

I would be prefer to use the Firebase DB, for "private" and low traffic (Users < 50).

# Project Short description:

This is a project like a shopping-apps!
The "idear behind" is it: Neighbor help other Neighbor.

# Example:

Neighbor 1. Have no time or a accident, or can't run/drive to the grocery store.
Neighbor 2. Drive/run regulary to this grocery store and have free place in the bag or car.

Neighbor 2. Will help Neighbor 1. and both can get in contact with this app.
Neighbor 1. Can create a list of food etc. what can buy inside this grocery store, and send
this list to Neighbor 2. when Neighbor 2. get in contact with Neighbor 1.
Neighbor 2. can buy each point of the list of Neighbor 1. and Neighbor 1. can pay after
delivery or befor deliver (related to know each other).

Inside this App can also the Neighbor 1. see the offers from grocery store and can create
within this offer-list his own list of food (shopping-list). This list can Neighbor 1. make
public or private, so can Neighbor 2. see what Neighbor 1. need and is space inside Neighbor 2. bag or car big enough !
